# Amazon Glow Revival
The Amazon Glow, a creation of Amazon, was introduced amid the Covid-19 pandemic with the aim of providing an entertaining way for children to engage with their family members at home. Regrettably, the product faced low demand, leading to its cancellation. To exacerbate the situation, Amazon issued an update, now infamously known as the “kill update,” rendering all Amazon Glow devices useless and contributing to electronic waste.

The Amazon Glow Revival (AGR) project is dedicated to resurrecting the Amazon Glow by reverse engineering its internal components and understanding its functionality. The primary objective of this initiative is to unlock the device's software, empowering developers to craft their own applications. Although not all Amazon Glow devices were affected by the kill update, a significant number of them were impacted. As part of the project, efforts are being made to reverse the effects of the update, aiming to revive bricked Amazon Glow devices and restore their functionality.
